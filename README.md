# Budget Buddy
Budget Buddy is a simple command-line interface application written in Go to help manage personal finances. This project serves as a way to improve my knowledge of Go developers, while also providing a useful application for budget management. The application connects to a database and supports basic financial operations, such as managing different types of money and recording transfers.
